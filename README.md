## Mail query
Mail query is a little C app I wrote which reads your existing mail for
addresses and presents them in a format such that mutt can use them for
tab completion. Given a small enough mailbox, it's usably fast.

It is available in its own [repo][].

[repo]: https://github.com/pbrisbin/mail-query

## Notmuch

Notmuch support is fully integrated in mutt-kz. Search with `,s`.

## Mutt

Mutt accesses the mailboxes under the two synced folders in `~/Mail` and
uses `folder-hook`s to adjust the appropriate settings (`from`,
`sendmail`, etc) depending on what folder you're in.

Be sure to review all settings and `man muttrc` for anything you don't
understand.
